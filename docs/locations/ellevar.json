Subterranean scans reveal numerous reservoirs of primal water just beneath the surface, often resulting in explosive geysers that burst forth from the ground.\n\nSuch phenomena are to be expected given the inherent instability of the substance - but the Pell, sadly, have begun to view them as something more divine.",

Not surprisingly, my opinions have not been popular among my colleagues.",

The intensity of its natural primal matrices is beyond anything that Iâ€™ve ever experienced, allowing me to manifest evocations of unexpected power. \n\nThese intensities also have a tangible impact on the life forms that exist in this forest, often resulting in individuals with drastically different physiologies and biological traits. This particular location seems especially prone to the phenomenon.",
