It was destroyed centuries ago, but its archaically designed neural processor is still functioning at an almost imperceptible level - allowing it to influence or control less advanced machines. I supposed I should be impressed with their durability, but I canâ€™t look at these pathetic rusting hulks and feel anything but disgust and disdain.",
