They are highly territorial, unnaturally aggressive, and display coordinated attack behaviors as they stalk their prey.\n\nAlthough I generally consider nature to be little more than a blind invalid playing games of chance, I must admit that these creatures are an inspired product of evolution. I must remember them for my future work.",
