With no natural predators on the moonâ€™s surface, it has developed little more than a thin, transparent membrane to protect its brain.\n\nIn most cases, I would assume that this trait was to allow more room for ongoing cerebral growth, but this creature displays a stunted intelligence at best. Big brain, little intelligence. It reminds me of Progenitor Ohmna.",
