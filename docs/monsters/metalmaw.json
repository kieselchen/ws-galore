When on land, the creature uses a pair of thick forelimbs for locomotion, and when submerged, a powerful tail and posterior fins allow it to achieve unparalleled speed and maneuverability.\n\nA short and heavily muscled neck connects its head to the broad torso, culminating in a wide, gaping maw lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth.\n\nSimply put, the beast is brilliantly designed - a frightening example of advanced genetic engineering.",
