I will indeed be one of the six vessels for the Genesis Prime.\nUnfortunately, my second petition was soundly rejected. Given the obvious superiority of my Order, I thought it was only logical that all six of the vessels be Evokers. The Archon appeared to understand my position, but made it clear that such a radical deviation from the current plan was not possible.",
